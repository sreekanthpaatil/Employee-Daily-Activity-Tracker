# Trackminster

Trackminster is a comprehensive tool designed to help employers keep track of their employees' daily work activities. This web application allows administrators to monitor employee tasks, generate graphical reports, and manage user accounts effectively.

## Features

1. **Admin Login**: Administrators can log in with their username and password to access the admin dashboard and perform administrative tasks.

2. **Employee Management**: Administrators can add employees to the system by providing necessary details such as Name, Mail ID, Contact Number, Department, Joining Date, and Password. This feature enables easy management of employee accounts.

3. **Role-Based Access**: Both administrators and employees can log in using the same URL but will be directed to their respective dashboards based on their roles. Administrators will have access to the admin dashboard, while employees will have access to their personalized employee dashboard.

4. **Employee Task Logging**: Employees can log their daily tasks, including breaks, meetings, and work activities. By clicking the "Add Task" button, employees can fill out a form with fields such as Task Description, Task Type (Break, Meeting, or Work), Start Time, and Time taken to complete the task in minutes.

5. **Multiple Tasks per Day**: Employees can add multiple tasks for a given day. However, they can only add tasks for the current day or past dates.

6. **Employee Dashboard**: The employee dashboard provides graphical information about the employee's tasks. It includes two pie chartsâ€”one for the current day and another for the previous day. The pie charts display data for break, meeting, and work activities. Additionally, a stacked bar chart shows three bars representing "Not Working" (including breaks), "Working" (including work tasks), and "Meeting" (including meetings). The stacked bar chart represents weekly data.

7. **Admin Dashboard**: The admin dashboard displays a list of all employees. When the admin clicks on any employee's name, both the pie chart and stacked bar chart for that employee will be visible. This allows administrators to analyze and compare the tasks and work patterns of different employees.

8. **Date Filtering**: Both employees and administrators can filter the data based on a selected date. When a date is selected, the pie chart for that specific date and all the tasks recorded on that date will be shown. This feature allows for detailed analysis of employee activities on specific days.

9. **Employee Deactivation**: Administrators have the authority to deactivate an employee. Once an employee is deactivated, they will no longer be able to log in or add any tasks. This feature ensures control and management of active employee accounts.

10. **Profile Update**: Employees can update their profiles and passwords through the profile section. They can modify details such as their name, contact number, department, and password. However, the email ID cannot be changed.
